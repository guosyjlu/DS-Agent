**Research Log:**
[Initial State] Lack of a baseline model as a good starting point for the current research problem.


[Experiment Summary]: In the last step, a simple baseline model for text classification was defined using logistic regression. The `train_model` function was modified to include a `CountVectorizer` to convert the text into a matrix of token counts. The model was trained using the training data and evaluated on the validation data.


[Experiment Result]: The accuracy of the model on the validation data was 0.7521367521367521. This is the first experiment result, so there is no previous performance to compare it to.

Here are some solution cases relevant to this research problem, each indicated by number identifier [].


**[1]**

(1) The overall design of this code is to train a model for a Kaggle competition on feedback effectiveness. It uses a transformer-based model architecture to perform token classification on the input text data. The code tokenizes the input text, adds special tokens for discourse types, and trains the model using the provided hyperparameters. Finally, it generates predictions on the test dataset and saves them in a submission file.

(2) The overall model architecture is based on a transformer model for token classification. It uses the "deberta-v3-large" pre-trained model as the base model. The input text is tokenized using the AutoTokenizer from the transformers library. Special tokens are added for each discourse type, such as "[CLS_CLAIM]" and "[END_CLAIM]". The tokenized input is then passed through the transformer model, and the output is fed into a linear layer for token classification. The model is trained using the AdamW optimizer with gradient checkpointing and mixed precision training (FP16). The training process includes multiple epochs and uses a batch size of 8 for training and 1 for evaluation.

(3) The important hyperparameters in this code are set in the "trainingargs" dictionary. Some of the key hyperparameters are:

- "output_dir": The directory where the trained model and other outputs will be saved.
- "do_train" and "do_eval": Boolean values indicating whether to perform training and evaluation, respectively.
- "per_device_train_batch_size" and "per_device_eval_batch_size": The batch size for training and evaluation, respectively.
- "learning_rate": The learning rate for the optimizer.
- "num_train_epochs": The number of training epochs.
- "warmup_ratio": The ratio of warmup steps to total training steps.
- "optim": The optimizer used for training (in this case, "adamw_torch").
- "logging_steps": The number of steps between logging training information.
- "save_strategy" and "evaluation_strategy": The strategy for saving and evaluating the model during training.
- "metric_for_best_model" and "greater_is_better": The metric used for selecting the best model during training.
- "seed": The random seed for reproducibility.
- "fp16": Boolean value indicating whether to use mixed precision training.
- "gradient_checkpointing": Boolean value indicating whether to use gradient checkpointing for memory optimization.
- "gradient_accumulation_steps": The number of steps to accumulate gradients before performing an optimizer step.

(4) The optimization objective is to minimize the loss function during training. The loss function used for token classification is not explicitly mentioned in the code, but it is likely to be the CrossEntropyLoss function, which measures the difference between the predicted probabilities and the true labels.

(5) The advanced machine learning technique used in this code is the transformer model architecture. Transformers have been shown to be highly effective for natural language processing tasks, including token classification. The code uses the "deberta-v3-large" pre-trained transformer model, which has been fine-tuned for token classification on the feedback effectiveness task.

(6) Some important tricks that play a role in high performance include:

- Tokenization: The code uses the AutoTokenizer from the transformers library to tokenize the input text. It adds special tokens for each discourse type, which helps the model learn the structure of the text.
- Label handling: The code handles the labels for token classification by aligning them with the input tokens. It assigns a label of -100 to tokens that are not CLS tokens, so that they are ignored by the loss function.
- Gradient checkpointing: The code uses gradient checkpointing, which trades off memory usage for computation time during backpropagation. This can be especially useful when training large models with limited GPU memory.
- Mixed precision training: The code uses mixed precision training (FP16) to speed up training and reduce memory usage. This technique takes advantage of the fact that some computations can be performed with lower precision without significantly affecting the final results.
- Grouping and batching: The code groups the input data by essay_id and applies batching to improve training efficiency. It also uses the DataCollatorForTokenClassification from the transformers library to handle padding and batching of the input data.
- Model ensemble: The code performs k-fold cross-validation and generates predictions for each fold. The final predictions are obtained by averaging the predictions from all folds, which can help improve the model's performance and reduce overfitting.

**[2]**

(1) The overall design of the code is to train multiple models using different architectures and techniques, and then combine their predictions using weighted averaging to obtain the final prediction.

(2) The overall model architecture consists of multiple models, including FeedbackModel and ModelYauhen. FeedbackModel uses the DeBERTa-Large backbone and applies different pooling techniques (such as All [CLS] token pooling and GeM pooling) to extract features from the input text. These features are then passed through a linear layer to obtain the final logits. ModelYauhen also uses the DeBERTa-Large backbone and applies word-level pooling to extract features from the input text. These features are then passed through a linear layer to obtain the final logits.

(3) The important hyper-parameters in this code are set in the configuration files (cfg.yaml) for each model. These hyper-parameters include the backbone architecture, whether to use lowercase text, the text column in the dataset, the cache directory for the backbone model, the path to the model checkpoint, and whether to add wide dropout or types to the model.

(4) The optimization objective is to minimize the cross-entropy loss between the predicted probabilities and the true labels. This is achieved by training the models using gradient descent and backpropagation.

(5) The advanced machine learning technique used in this code is the use of pre-trained transformer models (DeBERTa-Large) for text classification tasks. These models have been trained on large amounts of text data and can capture complex patterns and relationships in the text.

(6) Some important tricks that play a role in high performance include:

- Using different pooling techniques (such as All [CLS] token pooling and GeM pooling) to extract features from the input text.
- Applying word-level pooling to extract features from the input text.
- Using weighted averaging to combine the predictions of multiple models.
- Scaling the predicted probabilities to ensure that they sum to 1 and align with the label means.
- Using pre-trained transformer models (DeBERTa-Large) for text classification tasks, which have been shown to perform well on various natural language processing tasks.
- Using different data augmentation techniques, such as adding types or wide dropout, to improve the generalization ability of the models.
- Using ensemble methods to combine the predictions of multiple models and reduce the variance of the final prediction.

**[3]**

(1) The overall design of this code is to train a model for a Kaggle competition on feedback effectiveness prediction. It uses a combination of transformer-based models, lightGBM, and a neural network stacker to make predictions on the test set.

(2) The overall model architecture consists of three main components: a transformer-based model, a lightGBM model, and a neural network stacker.

- The transformer-based model is based on the DeBERTa-v3-large architecture. It takes in the essay text as input and encodes it using the transformer model. It then uses a custom pooling layer called NLPAllclsTokenPooling to pool the hidden states of specific tokens related to discourse types. The pooled features are then passed through a linear layer to obtain logits for each class.

- The lightGBM model takes in various features related to the discourse types, such as the discourse type itself, the predicted probabilities from the transformer-based model, the number of unique discourse types in an essay, the mean predicted probability of the "Ineffective" class, the length of the discourse text, and the number of paragraphs in the essay. It uses these features to make predictions on the effectiveness of the discourse.

- The neural network stacker takes in the predicted probabilities from the transformer-based model, the lightGBM model, and the neural network stacker itself. It concatenates these predictions and passes them through a series of linear layers with PReLU activations. The final layer outputs logits for each class.

(3) The important hyperparameters in this code are loaded from a YAML configuration file. The configuration file specifies the architecture of the transformer model, the maximum length of the input sequences, and the paths to the pre-trained models and tokenizers. These hyperparameters are used to initialize the transformer-based model and tokenizer.

(4) The optimization objective of this code is to minimize the cross-entropy loss between the predicted probabilities and the true labels. The code uses the nn.CrossEntropyLoss() function as the loss function for both the transformer-based model and the neural network stacker.

(5) The advanced machine learning technique used in this code is the transformer-based model. Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing tasks by capturing long-range dependencies and contextual information effectively. The DeBERTa-v3-large architecture used in this code is a state-of-the-art transformer model specifically designed for text classification tasks.

(6) Some important tricks that play a role in achieving high performance in this code include:

- Data preprocessing: The code preprocesses the essay texts and discourse texts by adding special tokens to mark the start and end of each discourse type. This helps the model capture the discourse structure effectively.
- Parallel processing: The code uses multiprocessing to parallelize the data loading and encoding steps, which can significantly speed up the training process.
- Pooling strategy: The NLPAllclsTokenPooling layer in the transformer-based model pools the hidden states of specific tokens related to discourse types. This pooling strategy helps the model focus on the most relevant information for predicting the effectiveness of the discourse.
- Ensemble learning: The code combines the predictions from multiple models, including the transformer-based model, lightGBM model, and neural network stacker, to make the final predictions. This ensemble approach helps improve the overall performance by leveraging the strengths of different models.

**[4]**

(1) The overall design of the code is to make predictions on a test dataset using multiple pre-trained models. The code loads the test dataset, creates a tokenizer, and defines the model architecture. It then loads the trained models, makes predictions on the test dataset using each model, and calculates the average prediction across all models. Finally, it saves the predictions to a CSV file.

(2) The overall model architecture is a combination of pre-trained transformer models and a linear regression layer. The code uses different pre-trained models such as Electra, Deberta, and BERT to extract features from the input text. These models are fine-tuned on a specific task, which is to predict the similarity score between two phrases. The output of the pre-trained models is passed through a linear regression layer to obtain the final prediction.

(3) The important hyperparameters in this code are:

- exp_id: The experiment ID used to identify the trained models and the output predictions.
- input_path: The path to the input data files.
- cpc_path: The path to the pre-processed CPC texts.
- model_path: The path to the pre-trained transformer models.
- trained_models: The path to the trained models.
- drop_folds: A list of fold numbers to skip during training.
- seed: The random seed for reproducibility.
- max_len: The maximum length of the input text.
- num_classes: The number of output classes.
- num_fold: The number of folds used for cross-validation.
- batch_size: The batch size for training and inference.
- device: The device to use for training and inference (CPU or GPU).

(4) The optimization objective is to minimize the mean squared error between the predicted similarity scores and the true similarity scores.

(5) The advanced machine learning technique used in this code is transfer learning. The code utilizes pre-trained transformer models that have been trained on large-scale language modeling tasks. These models are fine-tuned on the specific task of predicting similarity scores between phrases.

(6) Some important tricks that play a role in high performance include:

- Using multiple pre-trained models and averaging their predictions to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.
- Using attention mechanisms to capture important information from the input text.
- Using dropout layers to prevent overfitting and improve model robustness.
- Using softmax activation and label scaling to convert model outputs into similarity scores.
- Using a learning rate schedule to adjust the learning rate during training.
- Using k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model performance and select the best models.

**[5]**

(1) The overall design of the code is to make predictions on a given test dataset using multiple pre-trained models. The code loads the test dataset, tokenizes the text using different tokenizers, and then feeds the tokenized input to each model to obtain predictions. The predictions from each model are then combined using an ensemble approach to generate the final predictions.

(2) The overall model architecture used in this code is based on transformer models. The code utilizes different pre-trained transformer models such as Longformer, Funnel Transformers, and DeBERTa. These models are loaded using the AutoModel class from the transformers library. The input text is tokenized using the corresponding tokenizer for each model. The tokenized input is then passed through the transformer model, and the output is fed into a linear layer to obtain the final predictions. The models are trained using a multi-label classification objective.

(3) The important hyperparameters in this code are set using the `args` classes. Each `args` class represents a different model configuration and contains hyperparameters such as the input path, model path, batch size, maximum sequence length, and the folds to use for training. The hyperparameters are set based on the specific requirements of the competition and the performance of the models.

(4) The optimization objective of this code is to minimize the multi-label classification loss. The models are trained using a cross-entropy loss function, which measures the dissimilarity between the predicted probabilities and the true labels. The objective is to maximize the probability of the correct labels and minimize the probability of incorrect labels.

(5) The advanced machine learning technique used in this code is ensemble learning. The code combines the predictions from multiple models using a weighted average approach. Each model is assigned a weight based on its performance, and the final predictions are obtained by averaging the predictions from each model. This technique helps to improve the overall performance and robustness of the predictions.

(6) Some important tricks that play a role in achieving high performance in this code include:

- Data preprocessing: The code preprocesses the input text by removing inappropriate words and punctuation, and tokenizes the text using different tokenizers. This helps to improve the quality of the input data and ensure compatibility with the transformer models.
- Model selection: The code utilizes multiple pre-trained transformer models with different architectures and sizes. This allows for a diverse set of models to capture different aspects of the data and improve the overall performance.
- Ensemble learning: The code combines the predictions from multiple models using a weighted average approach. This helps to reduce the impact of individual model biases and improve the overall accuracy and robustness of the predictions.
- Hyperparameter tuning: The code sets the hyperparameters based on the specific requirements of the competition and the performance of the models. The hyperparameters are tuned to optimize the performance of the models and achieve high accuracy on the test dataset.

**Here is a past experience case written by an human expert for a relevant (but not the same) research problem:**

(1) The overall design of this code is to train a model for a Kaggle competition on feedback effectiveness. It uses a transformer-based model architecture to perform token classification on the input text data. The code tokenizes the input text, adds special tokens for discourse types, and trains the model using the provided hyperparameters. Finally, it generates predictions on the test dataset and saves them in a submission file.

### 2.2 Generated Output by LLM:

[Reflection]: The current research problem involves solving a machine learning task of text classification. The experiment is in its early stages, with a baseline model established using logistic regression. The accuracy of this model on the validation data is approximately 0.75. The current research log and Python code reveal that the model uses a CountVectorizer to convert the text into a matrix of token counts. The model is then trained using the training data and evaluated on the validation data.

[Reasoning]: The relevant case provides valuable insights into a similar problem. The case involves a transformer-based model architecture for token classification, which has been shown to be highly effective for natural language processing tasks. The case also highlights several techniques that could potentially improve the performance of the model for the current research problem, such as the use of special tokens to help the model learn the structure of the text, gradient checkpointing for memory optimization, and mixed precision training to speed up training and reduce memory usage.

[Thought]: The next step in the experiment could be to implement a transformer-based model architecture, such as BERT, for the text classification task. This would involve tokenizing the input text and passing it through the transformer model. The output of the transformer model could then be fed into a linear layer for classification. Furthermore, the learning rate and the number of training epochs could be tuned to optimize the performance of the model.

[Check]: The plan involves implementing a transformer-based model and tuning the learning rate and the number of training epochs. This does not require multiple experiment trials and has not been implemented in the current Python code. The plan does not violate the listed prohibitions as it does not involve visualization analysis, changing the dataset split, introducing new features, tuning more than two hyperparameters, or distributed training.

[Decision]: The next step in the experiment will involve implementing a transformer-based model, such as BERT, for the text classification task. The input text will be tokenized and passed through the transformer model. The output of the transformer model will be fed into a linear layer for classification. The learning rate and the number of training epochs will be tuned to optimize the performance of the model. The performance of the model will be evaluated using the accuracy metric on the validation set.
